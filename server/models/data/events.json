    "description": "Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker has been jailed for two and a half years for hiding £2.5m worth of assets and loans to avoid paying debts.\r\n\r\nThe 54-year-old six-time Grand Slam champion was found guilty of four charges under the Insolvency Act.\r\n\r\nThe case centred on Becker's bankruptcy in June 2017 resulting from an unpaid loan of more than £3m on his luxury estate in Mallorca, Spain.\r\n\r\nJudge Deborah Taylor said he had shown no remorse or acceptance of guilt.\r\n\r\nReferring to Becker's previous conviction for tax evasion in Germany in 2002, she told the former world number one: \"You did not heed the warning you were given and the chance you were given by the suspended sentence and that is a significant aggravating factor...\r\n\r\n\"You have... sought to distance yourself from your offending and your bankruptcy.",
